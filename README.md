# OpenBots
This repo is a simple implementation of RL algorithms in a PyBullet environment using PyTorch to train robots to perform various exercises.
For ```football.py``` to run, you will need to install the following pip packages:
```
pip install torch
pip install numpy
pip install pybullet
pip install robot_descriptions
```
The ```.pth``` files are currently unavailable as I haven't fully trained the models yet.
The codebase is relatively simple and should be intuitive enough to understand.
